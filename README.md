# Hitchiker-s-Guide-to-the-Galaxy-of-Reinforcement-Learning
A Complete tutorial of Deep Q learning and implementing them in PyTorch.

Pre Requisites:
  1. Understanding of Neural Networks
  2. Understanding of Probability Theory

To get started First Install the dependencies using Conda.
```
conda env create -f conda_environment.yaml
```

Export your Conda environment to the jupyter kernels, to use it with your notebook.
```
conda activate wbt
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=wbt
```
